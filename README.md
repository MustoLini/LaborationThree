# Laboration Three Working in Java FX
## Making a Paint Applictianon 
__________________________________________________
**__During these past 3 weeks we worked with Java FX and Learning to work with MVC (Mode, View, Controller) and the end resault was an application where you are able to draw out Squares and Circles and be able to open it in the Webb browser as a SVG file. You are also able to Undo object's that you have already created, and you are also able to switch Size and Color of the objects you have already drawn out though you're on selected mode.__**

## Problem Facing This Project

**__When I started this project, I had no clue how to work with scene builder and working with JavaFX and I did not understand why you should use MVC (Mode, View, Controller). But lucky for me I found some sources where to start to learn scene builder. ¨You can see at the bottom of this text¨. Those videos were really helpful and help me understand Scene Builder Completely and it help some to understand Java FX. The sources that we got from the assignment was good to read about to learn MVC, but they were pretty long so its tock it’s time. That goes for the SVG, and they were not that good documented on.__**
